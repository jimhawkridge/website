<p>io is our entry into the BBC's Techno Games
   2002 robotics competition. Designed by Jim,
   Maureen, Mike and
   Sara we entered her into the
   competition after seeing the 2001 Techno Games on TV in March 2001.</p>
<p>We
   decided to enter the Gymnastics event because we thought that it offered the
   best opportunity to build something new and interesting. Our team consists of
   people with backgrounds in Electronic and Mechanical Engineering and well as in
   Arts and Architecture. In fact Noel Sharkey, one of the presenters on the show,
   said that our robot was <i>"The perfect blend of art and technology"</i>.</p>

<div class="picture right"><img src="images/io2.jpeg" alt="Dad and Jim making io" width=267 height=200></div>
<p>We built the robot at home on our kitchen table (it's warmer than out in the
   garage) and for the mechanical contruction used mainly Mechano plus anything
   else we could find lying around. We also paid a trip to the local hardware store
   which is where we found the pipe bending spring which forms the spine of the
   robot. We also used papier mach√© for the head, dress boneing for the spiral and
   arcrylic sheet for the arms. For the decoration and "clothing" we used spray
   paint, silver coloured cloth, beads, cardboard, broken christmas decorations, an
   old bowl and more.</p>

<p>We decided to conceal all the "workings" underneath the base and
   control the arms and spine by using motors to pull on strings. Somewhat
   like a puppet or an automata. The spine was made of a pipe bendings
   spring which could be made to bend forward and backwards. The arms were made
   in sections out of acrylic sheet and would curve up and down when the
   strings were pulled and released.</p>

<p>To move the robot we use 4 motors. The two for
   powering the wheels were bought specially, the one for the arms was removed from
   an old toy car and the one that bends the spine backwards and forwards we had
   already. The motors are controlled by a PIC16F877, a cheap but relatively
   powerful microcontroller (a microcrontroller is like a small (in this case about
   5cm long) computer specifically designed for controlling electronic circuits).
   Potentiometers were rigged to provide information about the position of the
   spine and arms to the PIC. Potentiometers are like the volume control on a
   hi-fi, the PIC knows how far it has been turned and therefore how far the arms
   or spine have moved. We built 4 motor driver circuits to allow the PIC to
   control the motors. There is also a control panel to allow us to start and stop
   the robot and test it. The robot has a serial port to allow programs to be
   transferred to it from a PC.</p>

<p>After we'd been building the robot for a while we started looking for
   some music for her to perform to. We wanted something etherial or spacey and
   chose a tune called <i>Morning Star</i> by <i>Planet Heaven</i>. No, we hadn't
   heard of it either until we bought the CD. We loaded the song into a PC and
   edited it down to 2 minutes long (it was 10 minutes before editing). We then
   wrote down the times at which all the important moments in the song occured. The
   PIC program was then timed to run so that the robot would stop and start in the
   right places. We added beeps to the start of the song so that we knew exactly
   when to press the start button on the control panel. The whole process of
   choreographing the dance took about a day.</p>
